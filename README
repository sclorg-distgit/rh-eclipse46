Package %{scl_name} provides the Eclipse IDE with a set of extension plug-ins
delivered as a Software Collection. For more information about Software
Collections, see the scl(1) man page.

Usage: scl enable %{scl} 'eclipse'

Software Collections allow you to build and execute applications that are not
located in the filesystem root hierarchy, but are stored in an alternative
location, which is %{_scl_root} in case of the %{scl_name} collection.

When you want to work with the %{scl_name} collection, use the scl
utility (see the scl(1) man page for usage) to enable the scl
environment.

Examples:
scl enable %{scl_name} 'eclipse'
  Run the Eclipse IDE supplied by this Software Collection.

scl enable %{scl_name} 'command --arg'
  Run a specific command with the argument --arg within the %{scl_name}
  Software Collections environment.

scl enable %{scl_name} bash
  Run an interactive shell within the %{scl_name} Software Collection
  environment.
